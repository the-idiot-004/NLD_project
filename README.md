# Nonlinear Dynamics Explorations in Julia

This repository is an archive of my projects and simulations in the field of nonlinear dynamics (NLD). Each folder contains a separate, self-contained study on a specific topic.

## Project Topics

Please see the `README.md` file inside each directory for a detailed explanation of that specific topic.

1.  **[Harmonic Oscillator](./1_Harmonic_Oscillator/README.md)**
2.  **[Fractals](./2_Fractals/README.md)**
